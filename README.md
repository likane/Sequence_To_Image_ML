# Sequence_To_Image_ML

## About The Project
This project is associated with my thesis work for the Loyola Marymount University computer science department. In this project, three datasets (SPY Price, UK GDP IT sector, cifar10) are applied to classical, hybrid and quantum machine learning models. Our goal is to study the effects of transforming sequential data into image's and the performance of our learning models when applied.

The project was developed primarily on Google Colab which the suggested platform to run on.

### Abstract

In this research, we compare the performance of classical, quantum, and hybrid deep learning models on time series datasets transformed into image series sets. We utilize two different sequential datasets, one image dataset, and two different quantum deep learning approaches and compare them to their classical and hybrid counterparts. We assess the loss, accuracy, and learning rates of each model. Furthermore, we utilize a hyperparameter optimization tool to select deep learning models to assess the effect of classical hyperparameter tuning. 

### Built With
Major technologies used:

* TensorFlow
* TensorFlow Quantum
* Google Cirq
* Keras


### Prerequisites
This project builds on research in the fields of machine learning and quantum computing. We suggested a basic understanding of time series data analysis, convolutional neural networks, quantum computation and quantum machine learning prior to any further contributions or analysis.

### Getting Started and Installation
Please see the 'Resources' section of each notebook to review the specific requirements and versions for a successful run. To simulate our tests best, we suggest running on Google Colab.
