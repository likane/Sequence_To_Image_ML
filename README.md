# Sequence_To_Image_ML

## About The Project
This project is associated with my thesis work for the Loyola Marymount University computer science department. In this project, three datasets (SPY Price, UK GDP IT sector, cifar10) are applied to classical, hybrid and quantum machine learning models. Our goal is to study the effects of transforming sequential data into image's and the performance of our learning models when applied.

The project was developed primarily on Google Colab which the suggested platform to run on.

### Abstract



### Built With
Major technologies used:

* TensorFlow
* TensorFlow Quantum
* Google Cirq
* Keras

## Getting Started
The suggested 

### Prerequisites
This project builds on research in the fields of machine learning and quantum computing. We suggested a basic understanding of time series data analysis, convolutional neural networks, quantum computation and quantum machine learning prior to any further contributions or analysis.

### Installation
Please see the 'Resources' section of each notebook to review the specific requirements and versions for a successful run. To simulate our tests best, we suggest running on Google Colab.
